# AboutGUI
A Minecraft 1.20.4 Paper plugin that displays a graphical help interface, customized for Chunk Server.

# Usage
As a highly customized plugin for a specific server ~~(for convenience)~~ , we temporarily do not provide options to hot-change items in the bar.
If you want to change them, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/Stewawa/AboutGUI/fork), change related codes, then recompile.

# Todos in the future
Support dynamic loading of items, so there's no need to compile every time.
